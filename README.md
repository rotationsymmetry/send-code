# Send Code

## Feature
* Send a block text to terminal (ctrl-enter)
  * Send selected text if some text is selected.
  * Send current paragraph if no text is selected.
* Send current line to terminal (ctrl-cmd-enter)
* Open new tab of iTerm at the project root path. (ctrl-cmd-t)

If the file type is 'Python', code will be sent in bracketed block
so that iPython will accept multi-line code.

Currently, only iTerm is supported.
